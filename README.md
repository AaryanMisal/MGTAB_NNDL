# MGTAB
A Multi-relational Graph-Based Twitter Account Detection Benchmark

## Introduction

  MGTAB is the first standardized graph-based benchmark for stance and bot detection. MGTAB is built on the metadata of over 1.66 million users and 170 million tweets, to our knowledge, using the largest metadata in the field. Moreover, MGTAB contains 10,199 cross-validated, expertly annotated users, ensuring the high quality of the annotation. Unlike existing datasets, we constructed a standardized social graph of users, making graph-based account detection an easier problem. Specifically, we extracted the 20 user property features with the greatest information gain, user tweet features, and 7 relationships between users.
